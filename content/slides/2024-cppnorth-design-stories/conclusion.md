## If you _do_ enjoy this approach, try it out!

- Most of Carbon's current focus is on implementing a toolchain
- Periodically hit a corner we need to resolve, much like these
- Can follow along, or participate, and will learn both about Carbon and C++!
- We try to make language design and understanding _fun_, _joyful_, and _interesting_

## Or try it out in another context!

- Doesn't need to be Carbon! Or even C++!
- Design your own mini-language or mini-language-extension
