# Some key takeaways...

---

## Re-think traditional compiler design

---

## Challenge assumptions with aggressive goals

---

## Compiler & implementation design should be a major input to language design

---

## What's next for Carbon's toolchain?

## Future Carbon toolchain efforts include

- Complete semantic analysis and lowering
- Interop with C++ through Clang (come see tomorrow's keynote!)
- Bundling and being able to access a complete Clang-based C++ toolchain
- Modern error messages and diagnostics
- Building a `carbon-format` tool on top of the parser

## Future Carbon toolchain efforts include

- Generating arbitrary amounts of random Carbon source code
  - Parameterized distribution of language constructs
  - Parameterized distribution of name & comment lengths
  - Able to replicate representative distributions or edge cases
- Aggressive benchmarking & optimization of each layer
  - Maybe even generating C++ code for comparative benchmarking

- Modernize compiler design and implementation
- And deliver _radical_ improvements to compile times
