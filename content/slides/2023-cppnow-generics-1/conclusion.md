# Conclusion

---

## Generic programming is better with checking

- Better ergonomics
- More reliably better ergonomics
- Powerful abstraction tool when desired
- Efficient implementation strategies

---

## Entire language is better with foundations built on checked generics

- Better customization mechanics throughout the language
- Language constructs can be more easily customized
- Enables clean interface composition
- Generic programming becomes simpler as the language foundations are integrated
  - Increasingly erases the difference between non-generic and generic code.

---

## Carbon is developing and exploring this area

- What it looks like to build a checked generics system that interoperates with
  C++?
  - How do we support template generic code?
  - How do we model specialization?
  - How can we more pervasively integrate it into the foundations of
    the language?
- Hope to share what we learn and our experience
- Also would love to work with anyone interested in contributing to this space

## Next up, a break and then part 2:

## The _how_ of checked generics

{{% note %}}

The next session will dive deeply into some specifically difficult aspects of
building a really powerful and robust checked-generics system. Again, we'll be
covering C++, Swift, and Rust as well as sharing the approach we've ended up
with in Carbon
