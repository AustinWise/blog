Welcome everyone to my first "real" blog. =]

To set some initial expectations, not all of these posts will be of super high
quality published material. Often, I plan to use them for random musings and
thoughts which I might have posted somewhere like Twitter, but required a bit
more text or formatting than makes sense in toot or tweet. Plus, trying to have
a forum outside of the bad bird site these days.

If you'd like to discuss any of this, it'll need to be on a site designed around
discussion (and with a moderation system) rather than here. Feel free to share
and comment on the social media of your choosing.

I'm always interested in ideas for content you'd like to see here, and if we
collaborate much, I'm even open to guest or joint posts.

Hope you all enjoy!
