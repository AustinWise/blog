Welcome everyone to my first "real" blog. =]

To set some initial expectations, not all of these posts will be of super high
quality published material. Often, I plan to use them for random musings and
thoughts which I might have posted somewhere like
[Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io/), but required a bit more text or formatting
than makes sense in toot or tweet. Plus, Iâ€™d like a forum outside of the bad
bird site and more accessible than Mastodon.

All of these are _personal_ posts, mostly by me but I may host some guest posts
from time to time. Any and all views are those of the author(s) alone. While
this aims to be a technical blog, that extends to the industry, communities,
people, and context of tech. But it will also include lots of code, software,
performance, compiler, and programming language content.

If you'd like to discuss any of these posts, it'll need to be on a site designed
around discussion (and with a moderation system) rather than here. Feel free to
share and comment on the social media of your choosing.

I'm always interested in ideas for content you'd like to see here, and if we
collaborate lots, hit me up if you'd like to suggest a guest or joint post.

Hope you all enjoy!
