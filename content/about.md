Hi! My name is Chandler Carruth, and my pronouns are [he](http://pronoun.is/he)
or [they](http://pronoun.is/they) üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà.

I am a software engineer specializing in performance critical software,
performance optimization, optimizing compilers, programming languages, developer
tools, and open source software. I also care deeply about building inclusive and
welcoming communities, especially in the tech and OSS space. This is my personal
blog, where I share random thoughts on all of these subjects and more.

I founded and am one of the three leads of the
[Carbon Language](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) project which
is an experimental successor to C++. You can learn more about this from the
announcement keynote at [CppNorth 2022](https://cppnorth.ca/2022/index.html):

I have a long history of contributions to various parts of the LLVM project. My
particular focus areas in LLVM over the years include:

- Inlining
- Pass pipeline structuring, phase ordering, fixed-point optimization
- Canonicalization
- Intermediate representation design

There isn't a ton of information about many of these topics I can link to, but
over time I'll try to post and add to it here. I also gave a talk that provides
a high level introduction to how compiler optimization works:

I currently work at Google where I am the overall technical lead for its
Software Foundations and Programming Languages teams. Over the years, I have
worked extensively on Google's C++ programming language platform, including
WG21, LLVM, and Clang. I have also worked on parts of Google's distributed build
and source management system, and contributed to a few common libraries. That
said, all views on this site are my own and not those of my employer.

When not hammering away on a weirdly shaped keyboard, I enjoy sushi, fine
dining, brown spirits, and everything about wine.
