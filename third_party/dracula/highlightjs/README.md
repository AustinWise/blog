Loosely based on https://github.com/dracula/highlightjs

Converted to SCSS and heavily revamped based on testing with highlight.js on a
number of C++-related languages and in close consultation with documentation
both in
[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/css-classes-reference.html)
and the core [Dracula spec](https://spec.draculatheme.com/)
